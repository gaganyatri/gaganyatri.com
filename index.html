<center> Far better is it to dare mighty things,</center>

<center> to win glorious triumphs,</center>

<center> even though checkered by failure...</center>

<center> than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much,</center>

<center> because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.</center>

<center>.... Teddy Roosevelt</center>
