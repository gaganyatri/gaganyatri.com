When you keep shooting for the moon,

Most of them would miss the target.

Perchance you miss the coal deposits for the sake of the smallest diamond

Livelihoods are at stake again,

One shall take a bigger responsibility of building a home,

By taking a big risk on self.

Having redundancies along the way, is the best kept secret by the pioneers.

Being able to look in the future,

With one's dream/goal as the target location
