* Being Evicted from the Family Subsidy Apartment
* Stranded in the streets at midnight, with a closed door. Twice
* Prospects being rejected for lack of financial stability
* Living in different cheap motels just to break frequency of begging for a place to stay
* Almost being evicted again from temporary relocation from mistranslation
* A silver lining, unexpected windfall to be allocated a better subsidised home.
* Pushing through the pain, misery and shame, Living only for the day, made one survive the roller coaster month
