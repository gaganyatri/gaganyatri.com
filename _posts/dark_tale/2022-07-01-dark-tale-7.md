Its 4th of March today,

Having a breath of relief,

That I am starting a new in chapter in 2 weeks time.

The past 2-3 years were terrible & showed me despair

The deepest levels of pain

Now have to be proficient and diligent in all matters of life

Do not over-promise,

Do not jump half-baked into every new hype that flashes by.

Its time to build a nourishing career.

Invest your efforts with a project

That can provide justice to your efforts.

Keep the midnight oil burning, keep pushing the foot on the  pedal to the max.

There is beauty in balance, Everything in nature is balanced.

Disasters occur where there too much of a single thing.

Start breathing again,

Let go of the past and 

Turn off the Terror.
