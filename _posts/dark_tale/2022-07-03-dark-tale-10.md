A shock reverberated through the heart to

All over the body like painful pin pricks

When the news of your demise reched the ears

Everything that transpired between us,

Was displayed like a giant Kaleidoscpoe

With all our memories, mostly good, rarely bad.

It has taken almost a year to write this,

This is no proper goodbye, it will a one of the rare painful memories

The photo memories on Facebook, our old haunts of First Day First Show Movies

Still hurts and make the wound raw again.

The one great trip that topped it all to the Himalayas,

Now has become a bittersweet memory.

All strength drains out, whenever i scroll through Contacts

and see the trademark full teeth smile with worried brow.

Going to let you go now, finally gathered the strength to delete your contact

But our memories together will always be fresh, a jolt of life for we loved the same things

For you are one such person, who was intelligent but still humble and self-less 

To all of us who would always find you to get our doubts cleared and use you as a sounding board.

Thank you for being my friend and a happy memory. 

May God give your family strength and love .

Goodbye, ದೋಸ್ತ
