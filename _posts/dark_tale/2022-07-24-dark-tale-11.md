Any Interactions were terrifying

A call would send tremors and messages would just throw everything up in anxiety

Hiding from known faces to avoid glancing future questions became a muscle memory

While whole world slept, One's day would start to keep away from prying eyes,

all the while being kept awake by the numbness of binging web series,

Just doing everything to let another day pass, Just like the past month and the past 2 years.

Darkness was embraced till death took over
