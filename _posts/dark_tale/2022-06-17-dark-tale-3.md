When one's drowned in sorrow for a considerable time,

Any happiness or a bit of calm during the prolonged suffering feels clean.


But it does calm the nerves a bit, 

It's better to savour the day,

Because nothing is permanent in life, hope rises to have a semblance in life


Take things slowly, do it right the first time.

One task at a time reduces the pressure,

Go with small plans 

It is a long marathon, pace your current life.

Have a balance in work & life

Focus on the prioritized task, Ignore the distractions

& never repeat the things that failed you before

Not being constantly distracted is the ultimate goal


Build up life, slowly but surely.

Never ever over-promise and 

Lie yourself out of situations 

that you pushed oneself unnecessarily


Be happy, keep doing the right things

When continuous green lights follow your daily route and makes one happy

Then you can be finally satisfied 

That at least some of the worst misery is off
