Dear Sir/Madam,
Thank you providing the wonderful news of Inauguration of Huballi DC. I am Sahana Shetty, currently awaiting release 
mail to be part of a new Project. I am a native of Huballi since birth and have completed my education till 
Bachelor of Engineering in the city at KLE Tech University. 

I request you to consider providing Huballi as base location for the start of my Infosys career. 

The benefits of starting Development Center at Huballi would bring a lot of benefits viz.,
* Reduce CO2 Footprint - Waste reduced due to re-location and redundant purchase of items.
* Utilisation of Hybrid Work Model - More external talent would now consider moving back to Huballi, as it would help
  them rebase to native/nearby location.
* Happy and Content Infoscians - No longer required to commute 2 hours everyday to office and having to reside in
  constricted places. They can now have time and space to maintain work-life balance.
