Day 2 started with a grueling exercise regime, at the end of the trek we were thankful that our body was somewhat put to task during the exercise.  After the exercise we took a small excursion to the nearby panchpula waterfall around 5 km from the base camp. ( for all the Pokémon go players Dalhousie base camp is a pokestop).

We were disappointed initially as the forecasted snow was nowhere in sight. Christmas came early bringing with it loads of snow on Christmas eve, we were delighted seeing the snow falling in hordes,  it brought to an end our last minute plans to visit any place which has snowfall.
