### German Diaries 

The Pursuit of Dreams


The steelbirds are taxing, blinkin away the night sky to a new dawn, i get to ride an apparatus of complete
maic. Made up of bits of pieces held by nothin but bolts( All the prayers of the engineers and definitely the fliers who held their breath when it takes them to the heaves (:P skies)

### Prologue
The last few months have been a tumultous ride, nothin less than a perilious roller coaster without any railings for support.
. So many places things could have gone wrong, Somehow fate(lady luck?) started to smile its mercy when all hopes
were fast fading into oblivion , most things had touched nadir.

Dumb luck was ever present, it was like take the most stupidest challenge, it would somehow workout finally. The night sky is shredding its darkness to the hope and glow of a new day, a day for dreams and aspirations.
Seems appropriate travellin on a Dreamliner(787) in pursuit of my dreams.

### Beethoven Beckons
The maestro, virtuoso, Beethoven is the master of all things music. His compositions are a treat to the years.
