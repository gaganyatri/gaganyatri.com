The coffee that was taken 3 years ago, smelt and tasted still the same. The place is still hold its charm with its
idyllic backdrop and welcoming weary wanderers with warm atmosphere.

The Snow white ghost is a welcome addition & asks for a good ruffling of its fur as it nuzzles against everyone,
making one spend more time and perhaps order more(It should be their major selling point)

At the starting station for Bad Honnef, one can see Home-like structured restaurant in the horizon. The slow-pace
is a medicine for the ever jumping mind to move at a gradual pace. Breathe a little after a week of experimentation
and closing those tasks and all the myriad things one has to finish as mandatory activities.

Another week, another place which call home gor a weekend of rest to charge the life batteries and rejuvenation for 
a new week of possibilities and adventures.
