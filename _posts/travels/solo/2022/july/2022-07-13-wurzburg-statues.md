Based on a whim after observing a postcard, Wurzburg was to be the penultimate stop in the Bavarian exploration. The statues
on the Alte Mainbrucke were majestic, would look perfect on a chessboard, the size would have to be on the scale of Harry Potter 1st movie, Ron Weasley would have been surprised.

The Marienburg castle on the mountaintop with its surrounding moat built into the mountain, could withstand any army invasion in its time and for a few centuries to follow. The UNESCO world heritage tagged "ResidentPlatz" would walk into any Top10 list based on its appeal and grandeur.

Most importantly the city pays homage to its lost citizens and remembers the horrors of the holocast, making sure that such an act should never take place and should have never taken place. A series of bags, toys, trolleys are depicted on a platform outside the Hauptbahnof showcasing the bags that families with children had to carry when they were uprooted from their lives and thrown into concentration camps. Deportation of Jewish families took place from Wurzburg and surrounding areas, based on donations from locals the memorial has been built as a reminder to accept everyone as they are and not differentiate on any bias.

With a belly full breakfast at the DJH Wurzburg which itself is below the marienburg castle and is built like a fort providing safe sanctuary to wandering souls seeking a refuge for the night, it was time to say Goodbye to Wurzburg
