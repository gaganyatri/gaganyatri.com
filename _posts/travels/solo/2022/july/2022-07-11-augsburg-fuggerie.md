A quaint little city whose name I only recognised from the FC Augsburg Bundesliga team. Arrived to city as an unplanned last resort layover. 
It defintely holds a gem in Fuggerie Chapel. Wow, I had tears in my eyes after a long time after witnessing beautifully maintained 15th century church.

The paintings were so life-like and rich in colors, It felt like watching a High Definition(HD) poster. The fresco's and the overhead roof painting are so exquiste. Legs are already itching to visit the most wanted item in Europe bucket list very soon.

Art speaks to us even after centuries, a silent thank you to the curator, helpers and caretakers over the past 5 centuries who have watched oveer and preserved the marvellous beauty. 

Augsburg: Definitely added in the must-see list in Europe.
