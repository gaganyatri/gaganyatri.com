A 12 hrs Train Travel across states from West to South Germany.

* Starting from noon on 10th July from Bonn Hbf, standing seat for 1+ hrs till koblenz, then Re-11 Luxembourg train till Trier

* Immediately jumping the next train to Mannheim for a long trip, Again a standing seat for 30 mins then comfort for rest of journey to Mannheim.

* Destination was towards Munich, with no hostels available all the way till Augsburg, the journey would conclude finally at 11.30 at Augsburg with midnight deadline for check-in.

* Shock awaited at Mannheim, there was no direct connection onwards. It was a series of train hopping for another 6 hrs of travel. 

* From the info desk lady at the DB office, catching the next train in 1 minute was scepktical. 

  * Running across the width of the station  crossing 7 platform with a Backpack lugging, it was a sprint to eventually being able to catch the departing train 

* It was close call, now hoping that no trains would be delayed as there was only 5 mins grace time for changing 3 trains. The dreaded delay finally tool place before the last change from Treuchlingen to Augsburg.

  * Construction at Ansbach delayed departure by 16 mins eating into the final minutes required for the check-in deadline.

  * With worried faces all around the train carriage, as many were relying to catch their next train towards their destination.

  * The status on DB app finally changed to "Connecting train will wait" from "Connecting train may not be caught".

* With just 15 mins left on arrival at Augsburg HBF to make the deadine, the first mistake was not to take a Taxi to reach DJH.

  * Even though the signs for next bike were 0 availability, a tad overconfidence on covering the distance as suggested by Google maps finally hit the nail on the coffin. .

  * After eating up half the distance with fast walking and pedalling dangerously over unknown routes with just a voice telling where to go next. It was late.

* Ahh, late by a minute, clock showed 12.01 am July 11 2022.

  * The system was closed and now at midnight, I do not have a place for my head to sleep.

  * After calling around 10 numbers, most of which went to voice mail. One hotel was still taking in the midnight stragglers and I made it across to them at 12.45 am.

  * Though the price was 3-times the budgeted allocation, it was worth 10 times more for the valuable lesson learnt.

  * Need to learn the ability to make correct decisions during crunch times.

* After 13 hrs, I found a space for my weary body and distant mind to rest for the night and hope for a better day.

* To enjoy the second/third or is it the fourth new lease of life.
