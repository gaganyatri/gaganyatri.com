I have been working on a prototype application for Agriculture robotics since Oct 2022.
Source - https://github.com/slabstech/bhoomi

First step is to create a Web Application which uses Weather forecasts, Market Data
to provide Real-time notifications to farmers for agricultural activities.
Static data is currently provided at https://slabstech.com/raita/

Next step would be to create prototypes for ground level analysis using the "Bhoomi" project.

Please let me know if you have any questions and would like to collaborate on this project.

P.S : Any application developed would be open-sourced, Intellectual property would be protected
by creating Patent and provided Patent license for industries.
