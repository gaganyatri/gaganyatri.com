Today I finally get code access to playground in the browser. 

No more having multiple OS to test/debug code. Saves time and system memory by skipping VM images to try out the terminal after coding in Windows.

The first project is [Revive](https://github.com/sachinsshetty/revive) where i am creating a Technology Demonstrator based on Micro-service architecture built using ReactJS + SpringBoot.

* Build Steps
    * First Get Access :P
    * Clone the required repo from the search omnibox.
    * Choose the Language extension for your repo, its based on VSCode. 
        * Import the Project into workspace
        * Launch Deubg & Test to run main class
            * It magically ran bootRun taking the Main class from the build.gradle file
    * PostgreSQL is required for the project / Will temporarily switch to H2 for testing
