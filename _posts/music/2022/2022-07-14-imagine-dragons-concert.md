Preface : 

Enemy, Demons, Believer, Wrecked, Wahtever it takes - The list is endless for the love of Imagine Dragons music. July 14th MÃ¶nchengladbach hosts the singing maestro's.
3 years since attending the last concert of Bryan adams at nearby Oberhausen. The finale for Imagine Dragons mercury tour in Europe & also the final stop for my German exploration trip.

Life threw a curveball, making one without a place for the head. Shifting from place to place to criss-crossing the country to get close to the day of moving in.

The milestone to reach was the concert of Imagine Dragons, everything else was out of the priority list. A revival after the anguish of the two covid years. Here we go !!!
