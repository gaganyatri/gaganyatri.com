With the passage of days

When the efforts finally start to hold ground against the onslaught of misfortune

The tide has slowly turned with the weight now tilting towards the good side

The smile has started to slowly form at the edges

When the worries have been put to bay for another month

The air feels better today

The terror of not wanting to stay alive, has gone down a notch

Hope for a simple life, to be happy with everything already here

Do not wish for more, but do more with what one already has.
