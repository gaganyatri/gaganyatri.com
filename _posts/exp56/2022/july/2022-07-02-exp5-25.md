A silver lining can open to the world,

When you've been down on your knees,

Looking for a way out to settle down at the end of the Day


The first step starts with asking for help,

When we start to believe that

the options have run out,

There will still be a welcoming door,

If one does not stop knocking on the doors.


A Warm bed, A Cool bed cover & A Dark room with safety

Is all that the mind and body needs to be content.

When the morning starts with

A Hot clean bath, A Sumptuous breakfast &

A Piping hot Strong coffee to fuel the entire day

Its the best beginning to the new adventure


Being content is always a handhold away

Without the need for expensive luxuries

For we all start with Dirt and end up as Dirt.

Joy is always making the best out of circumstances.
