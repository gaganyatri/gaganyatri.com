We want someone to hear our pleas in despair

Someone to hear our thanks in euphoria

Someone to depend and hope for a better tomorrow

Just like car that takes one to the destination,

No matter what the brand or cost of the car, its purpose is to take a person from place to place

Just like God, there are different gods,

They have different names, they all help us to reach our destination

Safely with a promise of a fulfilling life.
