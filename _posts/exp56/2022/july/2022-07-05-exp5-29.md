Do not Fall for Hocus Pocus

Take a Minute, a Day, a Month

Before making making changes to existing schedule

The process is important to streamline priority work

It's good to have faster benefits, but it should never

Be prioritised over long term stability

The deep thinkers make the new discoveries and find a better way to do important work

Fixate rigourously on one goal, 

Till the finish line is reached, 

Do not take detour, For want of a easier journey

Take the road less taken, 

But only after traversing the the well-trodden path

For you would need landmarks

To get back to shelter.
