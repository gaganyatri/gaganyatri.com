Uncertain times hit one badly

It make hopes disappear in an instant and

Make dreams go through a painful slow death

Everything in life is a circle,

Sometime's one goes as high as possible and

Sometime's misfortune brings you down to the ground.

Eventually you will rise up

For there is no where deeper to fall anymore

Bouncing back is the option left with the back against the wall

We fall, But We Rise Again
