A pardon for an unintentional mistake

Brought about by a external disaster 

Brings relief for the anxious mind.

It is no longer necessary to relive past failures, 

One cannot be repenting for a pardoned offence for an entire life.

A new stage ti showcase and. build knowledge

A new platform to reach the next milestone

A sliver of hope is seeping into the 

Battered, list-less and darkened heart.

Slowly showing sigsn of natural calm heartbeat.

Signs of being auto-triggered are slowly diminishing,

As now information is chosen by choice,

Rather than being involutantarily fed unknowingly.

Build the base with experiences.
