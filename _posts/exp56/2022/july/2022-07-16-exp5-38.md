The fiercest critic for wrong decision,

The sympathetic listener for grievances,

A rational thinker for necessary actions & diligent taskmaster for priority work.

Thank you for being my support over the years,

It would have been very difficult without your support and savings hands

Multiple times when everything was a disaster 

You were the one constant of good hope, picking me up 

Whenever it was possible with your generosity

In bad times you were the support,

Let the good times make us grow wisely 

To support one another whenever necessary.

Thank you, friend
