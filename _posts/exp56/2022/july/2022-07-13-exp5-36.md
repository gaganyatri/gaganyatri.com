The early morning rituals of a person,

From being a consumer of non-stop scrolling knowledege,

To an avid producer of thoughts & ideas is a gamechanger

The clarity it brings to the day,

When the mind is sharpened by the tools

Of careful thought processes on how to spend the day via prioritization

Helps to reduce the clutter brought with uncertainty

When most days just fade by without any meaningful purpose.

The producer can choose when to push forward and when to step back,

By taking care of the necessities first and doing non-prioritsed items only in leisure

Become an early morning producer of knowledge.

Observe slowly how the gears of the mind mesh into place

And start to move mountains.
