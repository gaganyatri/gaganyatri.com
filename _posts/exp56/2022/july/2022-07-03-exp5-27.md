To reach safely onto ground.

One has to cross many a bridges. 

Some across small streams that one could just jump across. 

Some needing handholds to pass on to the next bank.

A Few treachorous one's where missteps are costly

And cause catastrophies

Look carefully and always keep a steady foot & never on two planks.

The journey could be less accident prone,

If one's focus and direction does not wander with every new air oppportunuties.
