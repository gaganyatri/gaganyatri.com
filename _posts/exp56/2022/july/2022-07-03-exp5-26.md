Escaping the foreign shores,

In the beginning of the pandemic was a blessing.

Then it started to get worse since

All the bridges to cross were burnt to keep the death away.

Without a path to return, the dreams

Started to crumble like sand castles on the beach, with sinking feeling

Expanding the pain every new day without a positive news.


The thing's said with an enlarged ego,

The dreams proclaimed to accomplish were going out of the mind,

Bringing more regrets than joy on a refreshing memory.


To be Contd..
