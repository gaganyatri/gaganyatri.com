Another Day, Another round of jumping places

For a place to my head

When the plan to try a new place fell badly.

There was an open door which was closed earlier.

Since the opportune time had passed.

A new night, a new bed.

Empty rooms, but safe from nature' cruel elements.

The doors that moeny can open is vast.

Save some moemy to wander.
