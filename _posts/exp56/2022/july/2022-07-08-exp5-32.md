Love what you do,

Do what you love,

Embrace it, Learn it as the one last task in the world

Hindsight is always 20:20,

When you hustle and Do whatever you can

Then myraid small branches 

Start to connect to the great trunk

That stands strong and tall for a long time to come.

Water it, Nurture it every single day

Single minded focus towards the milestons

Will be able to get the proverbial prize.

Hustle till last breath.
