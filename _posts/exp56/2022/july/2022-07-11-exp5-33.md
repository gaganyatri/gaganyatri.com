Its either done or not done

There is no middle ground

Nobody remembers the 2nd place winner

If you miss the train by a minute, its gone

You will have to run harder to get back on the missed train

If you are late by 10 seconds or 1 minute or an 1 hour

Your late, it does not matter by how much duration

Reduce the distractions, keep the unknown variables at bay

Only the next milestone and the path to be taken 

Should be in the sight, do not look around for detours

Most detours will bite back for not being traversed 

Run in the first degree, where everything changes fast

Do not lose track
