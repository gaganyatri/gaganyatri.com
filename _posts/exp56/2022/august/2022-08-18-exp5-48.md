When you realise that your opponent

Is a well entrenched, fully supplied with limitless and superior firepower

History advises to take a strategic retreat, To take small loss for now

& come back again with better preparation

For no general was never a martyr, trying to win everything in the first try

They became victorious by winning the last battle.

Like a knockout punch, always be the last man standing
