Whether you want a narrowly focussed person, who only does the tasks at hand

And doesn't build his knowledge by interactions with others

Who does not share the curiosity to learn new things and is not afraid to fail

Maybe I am the right place, but at the wrong time, 

For I will not be able to completely stop the flow

During the 2 years of haplessness before, I would have just nodded and do this as told.

Who knows what tomorrow will bring, Will i grow into the light

Will i fall back to the darkness, I will just put my focus into myself

Caring about every small task and doing things self-lessly is not appreciated,

I will no longer accept ridicule for things done with a good intention.

Take me to task for wrong thing and i will gladly take the feedback to improved.

How far will you let me fail ?

Was willing to let it go, cause it has refreshed past trauma as an individual opionion.

As its the consensus of more than a person, maybe i should start looking out for myself
