The best fight is the one which was never fought.

Choose your battles wisely, when the odds are against you.

The stepback, conceded temporary defeat and comeback stronger again

That's how persons with power play,

They blindside you with accusations and threats

And then they want to micro-manage you , so that they con contain the new threat

Gandhi started the movement which brought down the curtains on an oppressive power.

Fight not with others, Live with ahimsa
