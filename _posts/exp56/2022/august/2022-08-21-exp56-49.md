Wishing well seems to be springing back with life

Once when all wishes were turned inside out

When the pld days stacked with dread, 

Now start with a thankful prayer and wish

Shed the battle scars, do not carry the hurt into the new day

Breathe free, Breathe again, Remember what went wrong

Never wander, Never lose sight of the fight,

Fight for freedom, Freedom is your only choice

Free oneself from the shackles of self-imprisonment.

Live with Freedom again.
