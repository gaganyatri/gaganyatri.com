When you have been reveived from the jaws of death

When the lethargy and nothingness had filled last two years of the life's spent calendar

When just the thought of a new day had tremors shooting up the sides

But since you are awake again,

Get going on adventures like crossing milestones one by one and ticking out items from the bucketlist

Fire on all cyclinders to get maximum returns from the day. 

Complete atleast one postive task / improve a skill a day, which compounds over a period over a period of time

No mountain is too high to climb the summit,

You may not reach the summit in a Day, but if you keep covering one a step at a time,

By walking, running, jumping or even crawling every day, the summit will never be too far.

Push the envelope, Brighten the world with your actions
