Hustle Everyday

You never know what tomorrow will bring .

Cut down on costs, for every cent saved now will multiply later

Do whatever possible to reach more people,

Then slowly build the funnel to convert them into regular users

Solve you own problem with software

Only then can you think of solving it for others
