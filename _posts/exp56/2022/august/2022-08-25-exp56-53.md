A place called Home, in hardship and happiness

Today its definitely better than when i arrived long time ago. 

I wish i could have done more

Not breaking away from the place completely.

For i have a lot to contribute back to where i learnt a lot.

The temple visit would be a recurring event to come see you sometimes

Civilization perish, but cities always grow 

One day, you will be a crown jewel from the darkest pits of life now

Goodbye and Take care TABU
