Death and Taxes are inevitable in life

They hunt you together if you unsuspectingly allow yourself 

And become a Prey

Interest on your happiness grows meagerly and disciplined effort is necessary to keep it running.

Like Alice Says - "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"

Where interest on taxes and misery is compounded regularly. 

It keeps growing like a monster when ignored 

And finally chokes you with its deathgrip

There will be nowhere to hide from the taxes

And one becomes unable to live with the burden.

Unpaid Taxes== Death
