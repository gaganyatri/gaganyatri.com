When I had given up for a long time

They still had hopes on me

Inspite of their difficulties, they still gave me a hand to hold in the dark

That gave a fillip of boost which propelled away towards the light

Another smaller shoulder came way as a support. Enough to fend off misery for sometime

Its not the quantity of gifts, but the sincerity with which its given.

Turning points occurs for everyone, sometimes you get on it soon,

Sometimes life makes you wait for more, just so that you learn the way.
