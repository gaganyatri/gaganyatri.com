##### Past

Do not think what happened in the past,

You can no longer modify it.

##### Future

Do not think what will happen in the future,

You still have time to do something about it.

##### Now

Do not worry about what may go wrong now .

Do whatever is possible by you and in your control.

Leave everything else which cannot be changed by you.

Good or bad accept everything.

Bad luck and trouble always come together.

Take your time, But do not give up. Try

Try till you can and

When you pull yourself together,

Help others bring themselves up in some way
