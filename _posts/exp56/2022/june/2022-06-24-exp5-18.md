All the strikes are out. 

Highest level of abandonment and avoidance is complished now.

The proverbs got them right, "Best to keep away from a Fallen angel"

No wonder, people fallen down without grace, disappear leaving no trail

For one thing, they do not want to fall into the hands of their debtors

Two, they have been rejected so many times. They become but a shell of prior life.

Never again getting the will to reach out to anyone again.
