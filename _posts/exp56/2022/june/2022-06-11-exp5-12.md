Never again,

    Will He Bow his head down again
  
Never again,
  
    Will he ever beg anyone for help

Never gain,
  
    Will he ever wait for them choosing him as an option

Never again,

    Will he allow himself to be tolerated, ridiculed for his actions

The shell had cracked up under intense self created pressure,

Letting in every other vice without empathy, shame or remorse.

He gets to patch it up one by one, a harder shield to 

Protect himself against misery
