Feed the lion, Who wants to win 

Not the Hyena, who would sulk 

Forego the Pain

Ignore what could not actually happen

The one who can do it, 

Is yourself, 

Keep the Pace

Slow down a bit, if necessary

But don't ever turn back

On the worst time of life 

Ignore responsibilities at your mortal peril
