Push one self to the limits everyday

There are days that will backfire

Then there are days when you have the midas-touch

The law of averages eventually goes over to the +ve side,

You just have to keep pulling your weight

Make every day your first day

Prepare and start with loads of hope.

Broken clocks also get the time right, twice in a day-

Your Path to Prosperity could be just around the corner
