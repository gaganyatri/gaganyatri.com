Discipline works wonders when the routine is followed proficiently

It helps one to focus on the most relevant & important tasks at hand

Noise is removed & no tangential work is entertained as it breaks harmony with daily tasks

Discipline makes time for all the important necessities of life
* Early morning's for thinking in quiet solitude
* Time to get a daily dose of exercise to keep the heart ticking normally
* Plans for the day works most of the time, unless interrupted externally

You know what will happen today and what will happen tomorrow as
the tasks are broken in small achievable chunks

This knowing, helps a lot with anxiety kept in check

No wonders 'Habits maketh the man'
