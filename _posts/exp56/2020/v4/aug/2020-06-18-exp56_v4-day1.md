Being disconnected and glowering in one's own misery

Brought on oneself due to laziness and in-difference

Past has been travelled & many castles destroyed

Stand up one more time,

Stand up every time, your knocked down

Life's all about creating amazing experience and dreams

Build it all over again, this time family first and self next

Need to end splurging tendencies and wastefulness

Be it time, money, ties of life

Focus only on today's task, Do not go back to the past

There is nothing to rejoice and despair from it.

It's gone, only with lessons to be learnt
