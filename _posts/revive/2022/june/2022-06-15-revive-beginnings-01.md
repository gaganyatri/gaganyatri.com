There is excitement in the air

Trepidations are disappearing slowly 

Still there is a fear of crumbling down to darkness

It will be awhile to come out of the woods

Fear is mostly due to the prolonged negative thinking

Good things will eventually turn up, when

One keep's plodding ahead during the difficult times.

Take the hit, slow down if necessary. But

Try to keep going. I know

Someday's its impossible just to move out of the bed due to limbo

When you don't do anything, when you cannot do anything, because

There is no hope left

But, Today is a good day to breath again

It is a good day to seek out the sun

It is a good day to let your heart fly a bit

It is a good day to smile awhile at nothing

It is a good day to dream, dreams again

It is a good day to have a little more hope

It is a good day for a good laugh,

Wisdom is learning and understanding from past actions and

Not repeating the actions that were not fruitful.

Try not be the over the top and belligerent person who would jump at every fad

Have a bit of patience, take ample time and 

Do not rush things because you promised to over deliver inorder to be recognised. 

Instead, breathe a little. All great things take time
