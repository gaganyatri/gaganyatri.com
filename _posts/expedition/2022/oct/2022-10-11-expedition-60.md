I have grown stronger, learning from every failure

I have become independent, with understanding from every rejection

The more times I have heard a no, it has ignited my spirit to surpass milestones

What I did, I have done it with conviction

What I will do, I will finish it magnificently

For now patience and perseverance have become my shields of armor
