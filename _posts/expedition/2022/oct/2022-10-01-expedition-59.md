If I am not there

Today or tomorrow, The whole would still keep turning

Nothing would come grinding down to a halt

Other than the lives of my loved ones.

The promises I have made to myself and others, have to be fulfilled

That is my motivation to start the day, keeps me focussed and determined

The only idea that fortifies my discipline to keep going

To live everyday like the last day of my life

Full of life, love, letting others lives.

Contentful with my gifts, grateful and thankful for a new day

To put my effort to reach closer to my ambitions and dreams.
