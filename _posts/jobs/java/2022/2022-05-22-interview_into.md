Hello,

My name is Sachin Shetty, I have 5+ years professional experience in Java Full Stack Development.

Why the Role Matches -
Since my starting dev position in Ruby and C++, not having good tools for automation and upgrade functionality was major roadblock for dev creativity.  I experimented by patching scripts to speed up development time for setup and commit feedback.

My current project "Revive" https://github.com/sachinsshetty/revive tackles such a problem . It provides a simple template repository to speed setup for microservices framework. It is lightweight and design is based on loose coupling to reduce friction and provide options to choose any tech stack required. At JetBrains, the tool can be integrated into IDE as project starter template (Starting working to create a Plugin) and also my work could reach a bigger audience and people can build amazing projects by spinning up projects instantly without the need for time-consuming configuration.


Background -
I completed my bachelors in India with major in Information Science, At the University,  I built an Lab journal application for First Year Undergraduate students, It saved 100,000 papers every year. We won prizes at multiple product
competitions.

• At the end I also worked on Big Data Technology, where I created analytics reports on Mobile for Senior Level Executives.
• My team was 10 developers, and we worked in Agile Environment with 2-week sprints and Release every 3 months. In my project i was the highest rated developer for my interest in improving the technology with
experimentation and voluntary tech sessions provided to other teams.

-KLE Tech
• During this time I was interested in improving fraud detection algorithms, and I wanted to pursue master studies, I took a position as Research assistant at KLE Tech University where based on my research on Wheelchair detection algorithms i presented a paper at National conference . I also built an ML Application to detect Temple images.

EFI
• After completing 2 projects in 1-year period, I got my acceptance at University of Bonn and i moved to EFI India to finance my Masters Studies.
• At EFI, I worked on Print Floor Optimization for their EPACE productivity suite for Printing industry. I improved developer productivity by working on DevOps to reduce Software delivery team.
