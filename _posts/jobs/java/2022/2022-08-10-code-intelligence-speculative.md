Step 1 - 

Hi, 

It's been 3 years since I last visited your office at Bonn during Security Meetup. 
I am the guy in white t-shirt and crew-cut hairstyle in the [Meet Your New Team](https://7466322.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/7466322/hubfs/Founder%20+%20Team/Employer%20Branding/Employer%20Branding_400px_Square_png/9.png?width=575&name=9.png) 
page( 1st row, second image). I actually got my first student job, while talking to BusinessCode about Java upgrade 
path from Java 8 to 11.  My PR will do 
the same for Java 11 to 17.


Here's my [documentation](https://slabstech.com/docker/) of my prior work for upgrading Docker builds. (Now rechecking if distroless is better than alpine-linux.)
Everything is done from the browser using Codespaces. 
I am also building a Microservices template library called [Revive](https://github.com/slabstech/revive) since 3 months,
please do check it out. 

I have full stack software development experience as well as Research Experience using DeepLearning for CV. Here is the 
link for my [blog](https://gaganyatri.com), I have been writing since 8 years now and recently started writing
technical book on Revive(Fully automated publishing using GitHub Actions)

Hope to get an interview invite and showcase my project review as a task.
