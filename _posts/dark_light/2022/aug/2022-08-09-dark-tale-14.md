When you keep shooting for the moon,

Most of them would miss the target.

Perchance you miss the coal deposits for the sake of the smallest diamond

Livelihoods are at stake again,

One shall take a bigger responsibility of building a home,

By taking a big risk on self.

Having redundancies along the way, is the best kept secret by the pioneers.

Being able to look in the future,

With one's dream/goal as the target location, 

Trace back to today, It will show the roadmap to follow.

The tasks to accomplish, the habits and good traits to forms, the stuff one should not be repeating,

Learning to say no to non-ideal requests which takes up important time.

Make sure to cover all possible paths with insurance and backup.

For this life comes only once, 

Better not be caught napping again, 

For the last time, it almost put one to infinite sleep
