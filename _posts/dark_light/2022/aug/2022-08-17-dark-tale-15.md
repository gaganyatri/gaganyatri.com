3 months ago, life was desolate,

With no clue waht the next day would bring.

Every window & door to the outside was closed from the inside, 

More of a self-imprisonment and also to not let anyone to come inside.


Today, there seems to be a light at last, the destination

Is not reached yet, but one can see it on the map

With known opportunities and dangers

The issue of housing, debt-repayment and employment now are in temporary stability,

With its challenges and requirements

There are a few more items to cover and then finally taking a risk/requirement 

to alleviate family financial trouble brought by me moving here. 


Take on one day at a time, do your best, help those who need it whenever possible

Do not make new promises, maintain the status quo.

Take care of min, body and soul. Stay true to yourself

Keep building/creating your monalisa

The diamonds shine brighter with the more number of cuts, by the jeweller

So keep chipping away everyday bit by bit . 

Take care. ಗಗನ್ ಯಾತ್ರಿ
