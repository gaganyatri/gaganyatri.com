A wandering mind, without destination or focus.

Lost in the wilderness of nursery, avoidance and self-sabotage

Happiness seemed like finding the city of gold

Begging for existence was unhealthy daily occurence

Suicidal thoughts were recurring with alarming frequency

The worry of sabotaging others life was the last stop in taking any extreme measures

Selfishness was not enough to take the jump

Though the windows looked promising to end the misery

The winds have changed towards a bit of mellow

With the spirit of life reviving 

And the pursuit of Happiness restarting

Life looks like living again
