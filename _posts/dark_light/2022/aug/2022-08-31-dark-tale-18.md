The tree drops its closes branches to grow larger & taller

When the branch becomes a danger to other trees

When the tree is in danger of tilting because of weight of burden

Be like the tree, Get strong and live for the day

Whatever does not help you grow as a person and make you a good person

Drop of the bad habits and grow stronger

Zug endeth  hier, but another journey begins

Each new day is a present, Embrace life
