Situation was despicable, money was totally non-existent

Eating on meal in a day was

Like the only task of the day and royal feast at it.

Days would start with the chant - 'I want to die today'

Cannot take anymore of the debilitating anxiety anymore.

The sleep was unavailable and was in fits and bits.

The axe of eviction was ever hanging, having unpaid rents for months altogether

Living in hiding and in darkness for almost a year from the debtors

Heart would beat faster, every time there would be footsteps during the weekdays

Only weekdays were less traumatic.

A foriegn voice or a knock on the door would shoot pain  through the shoulder to the heart .

P.S - Do not want it to ever repeat to anyone
