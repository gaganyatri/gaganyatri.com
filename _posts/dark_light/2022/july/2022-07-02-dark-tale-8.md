When items are moved around from a bag to another

Trying to reduce what needs to be carried around.

When these are garbage bags, 

Then you know that you have screwed things up.

It is the last stage before items fall of the bags

Onto the streets

And then one has to start living in the streets

When youâ€™ve nowhere else to go,

Because your actions made the doors close on your face.

Between living in the safe shelter to the streets it is just a thin bag.
