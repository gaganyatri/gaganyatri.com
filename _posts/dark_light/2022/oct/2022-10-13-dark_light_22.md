One has to keep fulfilling dharma through ethical actions

Every opportunity learnt from difficulty is required to add wisdom

Do not covet others, wealth, fame and riches & tomorrow

Do what is necessary today, helping whoever you can along the way

Follow the path of dharma

To become one without being
