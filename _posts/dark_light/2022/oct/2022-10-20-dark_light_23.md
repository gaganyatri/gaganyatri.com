The festival of lights,

Deepavali celebrates the victory of dharma over darkness

Celebrating the return of Shri Ram from his 14-year exile to homeland

Celebrated by cleaning every nook and corner of home

To welcome prosperity and decorating homes with candles to show light to all

Prepare the onset of winter with a traditional bath using ayurvedic herbs and oil 

One removes the cobwebs, unused items, forgotten baggage's and welcomes the new onto the old

One wishes to lighten the burden taken up along the path

And choose the path of Dharma 

To lead a simple, happy and content life.
