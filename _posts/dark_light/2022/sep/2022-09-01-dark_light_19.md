To grow in a company, one would want to adhere to the leader's message

But its difficult to survive,

When the person above you, micromanages and analyses every move.

Stalls every step to become more than a team player.

When you are expected to just work and do nothing else

All ideas and additional work are dismissed with a smirk 

And suggestions are provided like advising a child

When help was requested to adjust timings for a few weeks

The lesson on time management was unnecessary as there actual problems which caused the issue

Then one week into the job, the working environment is changed

To a different one for which one was hired to work on

And expectation is to contribute at the same pace as others with experience

When guidance was requested before 3 weeks of vacation was announced and 

That there would be gap in direction, because everyone else was new.

It was rejected to accommodate another person's request

Shock awaited on arrival from vacation, with long list of complaints for all actions taken

What was one supposed to do without guidance into a new project and environment

One utilised the time to make new connections to help in some way in near future

For collaboration with other teams, just being on the screen would like talking 

through the window of the Jail Cell Room.

What do we do with conflicting ideologies
