A Thousand Memories in a single frame

The journey is all that matters,

Who did we meet for that short time,

Who became a part of our life, became close for the distance travelled.

Only memories survive the upheaval and wonder of time,

Collect them, Guard them, Cherish them.

Like an old friend, they will be there when you need them.

As an albatross circle the globe, the memories will be there to guide you.

Thank you for being a part of my journey.
