Fear has done its irrversible damage 

There is no any fear, or there is no response to any fear

Like the saying, 'Drink bit of venom everyday, You eventually become immune to the strong venom' 

Future is a blank canvas, But its still unwritten.

Feat no longer hangs its shadow, threatening to derails all plans

Pushing one into the deep loop of self doubt and unwanted rumination of living as a failure.

Its not the thing that will kill, But its the fear of the thing that eventually kills one slowly.

Empathy is slowly seeping back, For nothingness had completed its total dominance.
