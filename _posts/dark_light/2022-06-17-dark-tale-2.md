November was the month of ultimate terror

Money was non-existent and had run out of lenders

Was instructed point-blank to vacate the room over the weekend and be evicted

No payment was made to health bills in over a year

All in all, situation was a gigantic sinkhole which was devouring all parts of life

Death seemed to be only option to clear debts with insurance

Dexter saved the month, by delaying how to end life

Those graphic scenes brought a bad taste and would not 

Want to be remembered as mangled piece of flesh, spilled blood and broken bones.
