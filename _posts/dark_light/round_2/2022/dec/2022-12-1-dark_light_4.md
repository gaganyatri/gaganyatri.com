As i sit here in solitude, in the dawn of a new day

Life flashes back & grounds me to a reality check.

I have come so far based on the sacrifices of parents. 

There is a great story to unfold and create a wonder based on every decision taken at each moment

How big do you want your dream to unfold and grow ?

Life's defining moment comes to you with years of hard work, with focus and single-minded dedication towards the goal

I will make Bhoomi a household appliance, building it with empathy and love

Its time to move the needle bit by bit every day.

Let's take on the adventure by growing an amazing team for a beautiful new world
