Every human gets a different version of physical bodies. Excluding the definitions of vanity , some have healthy bodies,
some with congenital issues and some due to twist of fate have physical disability.  
Each culture has a different definition like in India it is Specially challenged/ abled and handicapped/disabled .

But each one of us have a Boundless soul. 
The soul has no limits. It can dream infinite dreams, it can pursue a million opportunities. 
Yes, there are drawbacks and multiple hoops to jump for mundane tasks for a majority of the population. 

Given the right tools, In our digital age, a large percentage of the specially challenged should
be provided with IT skills. There is a lot of demand and it will keep growing for the curious.

We need to boost this workforce by upskilling and training them for a range of online jobs.  Most jobs do
not necessarily require an Engineering degree and they can build an independent cottage industry.

We should connect the dots to provide assistance and let them build their dreams
and grow with a purpose along with everyone else, to bring our best selves to the society.

M.K. Gandhi - Poverty can be eliminated with Education. Education can erase generations of low income societies and
help people make sustainable choices.
