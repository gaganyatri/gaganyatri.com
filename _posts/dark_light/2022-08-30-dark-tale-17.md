Having anxiety with panic attacks is like being shot at.

The shock that flows through the heart, makes it difficult to breathe.

One becomes numb to the outside world and needs atleast a day to become normal

Mind automatically avoids the trigger at any cost

If its an event, one does not attend it

If its a person, one does not want to be in the vicinity of the troublemaker

Even though the other person is unaware of his/her actions

Finally, It became the straw that broke the camel's back.

Its time to move,

For the heart cannot take anymore attacks,

For one wishes to live again
