1. List all tasks and responsibilities
2. Assign priority to each task
3. Schedule each task to a deadline, especially the repeatable tasks
4. Split the tasks into digital work and manual work requiring office space
5. Time spent in travel is 3 hours every day, instead work from home for 2-3 days, finish the digital work and 2 days only manual work.
6. Delegate the work to others which are not your responsibility
7. Become strategic in your actions, one person need not do everything.  Only when the whole team works, the final product comes out great
8. Set targets and requirements so that unfinished work is immediately sent back with feedback.
