All Work and No Play

Makes Jack/Jill a

Dull Boy/Girl

------------

Another Step for the World

See the cultures anew

How life is lived at

The big, never sleeping metropolis

The small, slow rustic town

The tiny, time-paused villages


------

Each of us

Would eventually

Live and Pass these places

Multiple Time in Lives

----

See, Plan to visit a new place

Every month

If planned properly, you could see the whole world

----

follow my travels

From the backseat of Dad's Car

To the solo ride's on the seat of my Pulsar

To the trail hunting on the Mystery machine

To the blurring fast RE 5
