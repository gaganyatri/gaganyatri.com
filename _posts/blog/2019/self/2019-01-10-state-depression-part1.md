Depression, a taboo topic affecting many of us, needs to be addressed
openly by understanding it, its causes, symptoms, overcoming it and helping out others compassionately.

#### What is Depression ?

Physical injuries can be healed with medicines at the counter or treated by a doctor. It is external in nature which can be observed by others and its understood that the person is in pain and in need of help.

Depression is a mental health issue which usually onsets on a loss.
Be it personal relationships, failures in work, exams or losing beloved ones, when our realities fail to match with our expectations.

#### Causes

In our current age, where our (dis)connected lives due to extreme social media interactions/activities, where only the best moments are highlighted, it inadvertently causes a feeling of missing on certain things.

We need to understand that Life is a zero-sum game, Some will win and some shall lose. Our desperation of losing out on prized possession, we step into a self-created spiral of doubt, denial and low esteem.

Life is also a long marathon, with multiple stages where each of us gets a new opportunity to get back on our path of creation, no matter the previous drawbacks.

#### Self Example

Would be my own journey, after leaving a high-paying job in search of
promised opportunities leading to change of cities. When the opportunity did not pan and meet my expectations. It was a difficult stage where demons seemed to pop out of everywhere causing untold miseries. The simulations running in the mind of what could have been was a daily torture.

#### Overcoming It
Thankfully the stage passed out & i could go back to where i left earlier, albeit maybe i was a little left behind without the detour.
Now i am able to confidently face anything come what may, because i have passed through a very difficult phase and i know that even this will pass. Everything is temporary, learning to let go is a lesson to be learnt by all .

Having a good support system of family and friends is extremely important, but opening about our issues and talking about our fears and failures is the way i see to beat Depression. We need to slowly and surely get work some done to loosen our self imposed grip.

There could be instances of ridicule by talking to a wrong person who might not seem to understand and maybe just brush it off, it is very important to talk to someone and lessen the weight on ourselves.
