#### Bumblebee Origins

#### This blog series, contains the learning from the Humanoid Robots Lab(HRL) at Uni-Bonn.

### Also this would lead me to build my Bumblebee, even the thought of building a robot gives Goosebumps entire day.

Today starts the first steps of my very own Bumblebee. Someone great has told "Transformers's Lets Roll ":P.  
Its time to be the master creator of Transformers . That one dream/challenge that used to make everthing happy when i 
was 13/14, i wanted to build a flying plane that would split the Awesome fighter Aircraft 
of Swat Kats( Psst. Cognitive Robots Labs ).The endless, countless , on a repeat loop of watching the transformers movie series and reading the comics, finally
makes sense. See there is something called Good TV addiction .:P:P. 

### Skipping a Beat
Heart skipped a beat when the Nao Robot stood up when it was switched off. It was(will be my pet robot) the best 
feeling ever (next to the Falcon Heavy Landing) watching a lifeless machine come to life. (Thank You Everyone who built
the Robot with such love and care, the effort put in by the people is enormous. It is the beauty of OpenSource tech) .
The small kid in me was delirious with happiness and literally had to wipe off a tear of Joy ( All this while the instrucotor was giving a demo). It was like someting on the lines of meeting your superhero.
