### Today is the day

#### Completing 27 summers.


Milestone no. 27 just passed by, time they say Never forgives. Few times its good, few times
horrible than anything. All that you learn (If you learn, at all) is that everythin will pass.
That's the reason we've the phrase 'Today is a Present :P". So enjoy the max when times are good,
when the chips are down and all hope seems lost, just remember, Even this will pass.
