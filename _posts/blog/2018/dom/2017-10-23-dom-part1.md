##### Dominique

It has been years since the separation. Years of agony, bewilderment, depression, words will have no meaning, it just cant be described

What all has not been done, to forget you.
Hating you , despising you, maligning you, giving you the worst possible names. Why did all that turn to dust.

Because no matter the words,
be it
