Can you stand your ground and win in any of the following scenarios
- Fist fight with a mother of three : Mary Kom
- Wrestling match with any of the 3 siblings : Phogat Sisters
- Come with better human empowerment schemes than a teacher : Sudha Murthy
- Beat the record for the longest time spent in Space : Sunita Williams
- Our daily break maker : Our mothers and countless sisters.


I'm prejudiced with examples i took above.

They are the shining lights in our time . Aren't they ?

But if you carefully read the last point. It cover's the entire woman population,
more than 48% of the world .


#### President's Highest Merit Winner

A girl was humiliated (Not the first and i wish would be the last). I swear i  will not use the 4ltter word ever again.

It was done by a set of parents . (Am i mad/blind to make these blatant accusations).
Was it not by a set of worthless boys who should be shot at sight .
No no. They should get an easy death.
The world has developed so many world class techniques.

Typing the most horrible words i never want to repeat again

##### But then why ?
- Is a girl child not allowed to travel at night
- Is a girl child not allowed to wear the clothes she wants
- Is a girl child not allowed to pursue her dreams, which most parents squash by getting them married. (More on this later. Come back in 2 days)

Is it because they were born as girls

##### Where is the issue ?

- The girls ?
- The boys ?
- The teachers ?
- The police ?
- The doctor ?
- Current Trending favorite : The government ?

##### The problem is with parents .

I beg all the parents and all the parents to be .
Please give a little time for the growth of your child.


Do not let it become a monster and a scourge of the society.

#### Your duty

Your duty does not vanish by giving birth to another life on earth,

It does not vanish when you send it to an expensive and prestigious school.


##### The child will always follow and imitate what it sees at home everyday.

Whom should we hang now for the humiliation that is faced by so many of our sisters,
mothers, relatives

Who can stop the death of society ?

Please think again for heavens sake

##### Can you ?  

P S:
I sometimes wonder, Should i bring a child of my own into this world.

Will it become a monsters learning from the other Monsters.

Seriusly, makes me think, Will i ever give my child the life it should get.
