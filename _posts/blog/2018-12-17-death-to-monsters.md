Typing the most horrible words i never want to repeat again

The problem is with parents .

I beg all the parents and all the parents to be .
Please give a little time for the growth of your child.

Do not let it become a monster and a scourge of the society.


Your duty does not vanish by giving birth to another life on earth, It does not vanish when you send it to an expensive and prestigious school.


The child will always follow and imitate what it sees at home everyday.

Whom should we hang now for the humiliation that is faced by so many of our sisters,
mothers, relatives

Who can stop the death of society ?

Please think again for heavens sake

Can you ?  

P S:
I sometimes wonder, Should i bring a child of my own into this world.

Will it become a monsters learning from the other Monsters.

Seriusly, makes me think, Will i ever give my child the life it should get.
