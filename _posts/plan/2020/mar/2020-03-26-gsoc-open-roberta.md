Help us out:
Review the GSoC Rules at https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/ and make sure you understand and comply with them.
Review the Jenkins Organization Student Guidelines and make sure you understand and comply with them.
If you are an accepted student in the United States of America on an F1 visa, you must obtain an authorization before you can participate.
Make a copy of this Google Documents file and rename it following the pattern: GSOC2020_LASTNAME_ProposalName
Ensure a link to your proposal is posted to the Jenkins GSoC mailing list with the subject: “[GSOC 2020 PROPOSAL] Your Name and the Project Title”
The “Project Title” should match one of the project idea names.
Provide answers to all the sections listed below. Do not just provide this document.
Ask on the Jenkins GSoC mailing list if you do not understand something.
Share the proposal with potential mentors.
Get reviews early and often. Discuss your project on the Jenkins GSoC mailing list or on the appropriate Jenkins Gitter Channel before you write your proposal!
Fix any dates that are not consistent with the GSoC Timeline.

Remember: This is NOT the OFFICIAL application. You need to submit to Google! Convert this document to a PDF when you are satisfied, and submit it.

Project Abstract.  This is a summary paragraph on the goal(s) of your project. (not more than 50-60 words)

Project Description. This is a description of what your project entails.  It is important to include what your project brings to Jenkins.
Hints: Describe what’s missing (for e.g. a feature, more coverage, whatever your core project idea), why you think it must be there (its importance). Also try to include the benefits to Jenkins and finally, not in more than 2 sentences why you chose this project.

Project Deliverables
Note: The dates in the GSoC Timeline takes precedence over this document
GSoC Timeline: https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline
May 4: Community bonding begins. Get to know your mentors, what will you need for your development environment? What aspects of the projecy objectives need to be clarified or expanded? What mailing list and other on-line communication means will you use and join? At the minimum, you will need to establish a github account and share it with your mentor, backup mentors, Jenkins organization administrator, and any other community members via the Jenkins GSoC mailing list.
June 1 (coding begins) - What will you have to do to ensure that coding starts by this date?  We expect you will have a development environment for Jenkins (core, plugin or other) working as part of the proposal effort.  
June 29-July3 (Phase 1 Evaluation) - What will you have done by this point?  Your mentor will use this to judge your progress and whether you pass or fail.
July 27-31 (Phase 2 Evaluation) - What will you have done by this point?  Your mentor will use this to judge your progress and whether you pass or fail.
August 24-31 (Final Evaluation) - What will you have done at this point?  What will you deliver?   Your mentor will use this to judge your progress and whether you pass or fail.
Sept 8 (Final Results Announced) - What will you have done at this point? You can use the period between Final Evaluation and here to do clean up, improve documentation, etc.
Post GSOC - What will you do?


Proposed Schedule

During each phase, please make it clear whether code will be ready to be submitted for inclusion.  Also ensure that your code will be available for review almost every day.  Do not work long periods (more than 2-3 days) without submitting code to the git repository for your project. You should normally commit code to Github everyday or almost every day (except weekends).

March 16 - March 31 (Application Period)

What will you do during this period?

April 1  - May 4 (Acceptance Waiting Period)

What will you do during this period?

May 4  - June 1 (Community Bonding Period)

What will you do during this period?

June 1 - July 3 (Coding period 1)

What will you do during this period?

Remember that your coding phase 1 evaluation is at the end of this period (June 29 - July 3).  You need to make deliverables for phase 1 before the evaluation period. Make sure you spend time on your presentation slides.

July 3 - July 31 (Coding period 2)

What will you do during this period?

Remember that your coding phase 2 evaluation is at the end of this period (July 27-31) before the evaluation period.  You need to make deliverables for phase 2 before the evaluation period. Make sure you spend time to work on your presentation slides.

July 31 - Aug 24 (Coding period 3)

What will you do during this period?

Remember that your coding phase 3 FINAL evaluation is at the end of this period (Aug 24-31).  You need to make deliverables for final milestones and prepare for writing documentation and code submission before this period ends. Make sure you spend time to work on your presentation slides.

Future Improvements

Here, some future improvements on this project are proposed. This would be done after the GSoC program timeline or as Bonus implementation during the program itself if things go better than expected.

Continued Involvement

How do you want to be involved with Jenkins in the future?  What role do you see yourself growing into?  Consider this like a career statement for your role in the Jenkins Project.  Your mentors can help you achieve your goals.

Conflict of Interests or Commitment

State whether you may have any conflicts that may prevent you from working at full potential or may not allow you to contribute code you develop during GSoC. Possible reasons would include participating in a summer internship, or a scholarship/fellowship at your school that restricts your ability to claim a copyright on your work. Although working or being funded by your school can be OK with GSoC, we need to know about your other commitments, and also need to be certain that the code you write can be contributed by you to Jenkins without a claim by your employer or University.

If you are an accepted student in the United States of America on an F1 visa, you must obtain an authorization before you can participate. Discovering this after you’ve been accepted results in the slot being lost.


Major Challenges foreseen

Discuss any of the challenges that you see could make your project difficult or issues you need to resolve.
