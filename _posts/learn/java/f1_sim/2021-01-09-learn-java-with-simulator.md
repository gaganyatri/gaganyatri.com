Formula 1 is a competitive racing league where strategy is important for good results.

We will build a Strategy simulator to Learn concepts of Java and Application for AI theory.  

Rookie mode and Challenger mode will be the different paths to implement the simulator. The objectives will be same for both mode.

Rookie mode will build everything from scratch and will have to put in additional effort than Challenger mode. Rookie mode is for new learners of Java and Challenger mode is for existing users.


* Objectives
  * Data Structures
    * v1 - Creating the simulator - Define Class
    * v2 - Read the different I/O sources
    * v3 - Choosing Data Structures - Object modelling

  * Algorithms
    * v1 - Final Race Classification -
    * v2 - Pit Stop Strategy -
    * v3 - Tyre compounds for 2021 race calendar -
    * v4 - Counter Pit Stop, Race restarts -
    * v5 - Qualifying modes - Fuel level and tyre compounds

Below lists will be updated regularly with designs and implementation with new learnings from collaborations. Collaboration between Sachin and Varun, follow the github profiles to view timeline of execution.
