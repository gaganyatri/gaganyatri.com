Ferrari is the pinnacle of beauty and power, ever since a kid the ferrari red always hold a special place.

It must be more than 6 years ago, when i first read the book "The monk who sold his ferrari", what was curiosity to know
who and what person would sell a ferrari has been an amazing journey till date, while currently reading "5 am club".

Since then, i've been reading all the books written by Robin Sharma, the books are a prized possession. They contain more gems
and riches than found anywhere on earth. It has made such a significance in my life, that i understood that his books will
bring joy to everyone who reads it. Now, most of us present bouquets/chocolates as gifts, i made a choice to always give books
as gifts.

Till date, thanks to God's grace in the form of a good life, i happily have gifted 50+ books of Robin Sharma,
some to my friends at Subex, some to the students at my alma mater St Mary's School, Huballi.

All the books contain a main theme "Dharma", the root word behind Integrity.
