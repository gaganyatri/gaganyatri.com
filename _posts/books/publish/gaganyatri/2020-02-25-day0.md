Chapter 0 - Landing Stage


Touchdown on the real planet in the (full) presence of Sun. The automatic guidance system slowly decelerates the lander. The system identifies the sequence based on the parameters observed on the state of the art Sensors. The reverse thrusters working in tandem to stabilise the vertical descent as it approaches the landmass. Though a small devil storm was playing truant testing the landing procedure, the system was performing nominally as it had tried millions of simulations and stored in memory to adjust accordingly.
