Days passed with the rush of mid-term exams with a sprinkling of messages exchanged between him, there seemed to be an unlimited supply of words with him. He seemed to keep things close to his heart, constant poking required to spill anything that he dint want to talk about.

News reached that there was college fest in his college, should i ask him what events to participate or would he invite me himself to meet properly. The birds must have sung my message to him somehow, within a day , there was his message offering chauffer service's to the events in his college. Though i did want to go all 3 days and spend more time, better would be 1 day, here i was preparing a report for a competition in his college fest. I chose the one, where he wasn't involved directly.

Phew, she replied that day itself. What was the deal with so many !!!! exclamation symbols in the first message. Thoughts started swirling in his head, was she as glad as him. I kept looking around for her in the last day in the huge auditorium, like a mirage most faces started to look like her, though i did really feel a tug that she was looking at me when i was leaving the college with friends. funny round events these last few days, time seemed to have flown faster but definitely etched in memory forever.

Sitting in my class, listening to the lectures trying to be awake, poems started to start save me from dozing over and getting scolded from the master fury. Poems about the class crush was the mood of the day, though she was also a friend, the poems started to affect not the crush, but to the others who also had a crush on her.

Guess who started to be the first one to read my draft poems, it was the girl on the other side of the lake. We would discuss about our projects and sources for our upcoming big project, here i was trying to pry away as much information about her.  With our own college fest coming the next month, here was my opportunity to meet her properly again. This time as friends and not like student-invigilator that we both encountered the first time. I offered my services as a guide around our college and the events, she finally agreed to participate in a project essay competition. Luckily i knew the organiser, i could get into her event without being too obvious.

The day of her event soon enough, my bad luck getting stuck in my own competition i couldn't meet her until the end of her competition.
