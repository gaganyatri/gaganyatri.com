A Child is separated from her tribe during an apocalyspe. After years of struggle and growing up in the huge cavern,  a shelter she called home.

She doesnâ€™t know anything about the new world climate. All she has is a small rock slab,   a small drawing she drew with her mom( she cant remember the face exactly now). But she remembers the joy after drawing her home with her mom, dad, brother and her pet wolf in their small dwelling.


One day she finds a way/path which leads her out of the cave.

Outside the cave, her hand glances over an engraving etched into the stone . she knows Its a recent etch,

A new feeling grows strong in her body, a feeling that she remembers/that her hands felt years ago, drawing it for many days years ago .

This engraving is similar to the stone slab that she carries with her everywhere.  

There were two copies of the slab, one for her and one for her brother.

Level 1 - Sewers

The apocalypse destroyed most of the terraform, all the buildings over ground became inhabitable for weeks/months/years due to gigantic solar flare and the extreme heat.

The remaining population of survivors, those who could take shelter in the underground in the nick of time , now had to survive the sewers.
