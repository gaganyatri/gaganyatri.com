* Why do i Exist ?
* Why does S Labs exist ?
* What is the purpose and mission for S Labs ?


I would like to thank my family and friends for the awards. My father for
sacrificing his best years for his children's education and stability. For teaching me 
to bootstrap projects and learn to do more with less.

My mother for teaching me to be resilient. She always welcomes the new day with hope
and smile even if the previous days were all about taking hits and body blows

My sister for being supportive of my activities and teaching me to be balanced in all path of life.

My friend Deepansh for being a support during the difficult times.


* Start small, Daily improvement with content and lifelong pursuit to mastery
