Setting your laser insights on the goal & getting to work does not allow insecurities or manufactured fears to get in the 
way of your dream

You can't let that happen, you won't let that happen

Hit the ground every day, Show up with your best work at each moment

Lead the way in execution, Show how one can do great things.
